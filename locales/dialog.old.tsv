LOGFELLA_INTRO_ADV	Logfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		The wood-chopping woodsman chopped wood. #obviously #woodchopping			71	007.jpg	70E70
				To the mountain folk of The Caucasus he was known as 'Logfella' & he seemed cool.					
				Logfella knew all about our woeful errand & he agreed to lead us up the old road.					
				Still we definitely got the feeling that he wasn't super jazzed about this.					
LOGFELLA_TADPOL_WAITING	Logfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		The woodsman waited for us to continue along the path to the start of the old road.			12	008.jpg	U0D88
LOGFELLA_INTRO_CHASM	The Scythian	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		We had bridged the chasm & we felt super smart.			22	009.jpg	L0B9S
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	We told Logfella that we sought a burdensome book of sinister sworcery known as The Megatome.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	The Megatome lurked somewhere in the haunted darkness beyond The Perilous Precipice beneath Mingi Taw.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	We resolved to go get The Megatome & then get out alive.					
LOGFELLA_BEFOREWALL	The Scythian		AdventureUI/keyItem	The woodsman confirmed 100% that he had the only key to the locked door in the stone wall.					
			AdventureUI/keyItem	It was a really nice-looking key.					
				We were totally ready to just touch & hold on the path ahead to move it move it move it.

LOGFELLA_HINT_SITTINGDOWN	The Scythian	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		The woodsman known as Logfella had chosen to chill out beneath a stone shelter near The Perilous Precipice.					
				Logfella seemed to know all about the loathsome rainbow & the nearby glyph depicting the skyward sword.					
				And yet Logfella offered zero help about what to do next, which kinda rubbed us the wrong way if we're being totally honest.					
LOGFELLA_WOLF_HINT	The Scythian	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		The woodsman had seen some kind of creepy monster thing & he figured he'd just let us handle it.			26	010.jpg	Q1B00

LOGFELLA_CABINMEGATOME	The Scythian	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		In the light of the gathering storm Logfella admitted he had a serious case of the heebie jeebies right about now.					
				Was Logfella intentionally freaking us out? #yes #no #maybe					
				In any case it was probably totally safe to just take shelter for a bit.

ARCHETYPE_TUTORIAL	The Archetype	AdventureUI/tweetIconInfo							
	The Archetype			Ladies & the gentlemen, how's about you tap these two little sylvan sprites so I can get a feel for your stereo sound system?					
	The Archetype			Since our prior experiment in 2011, social networks have proven to be catastrophic for society.					
				This time we encourage isolation & regretful reflection.					
				We are profoundly grateful that you have chosen to participate in this experimental treatment for acute soul-sickness.					
				You'll find this first S:S&S EP session to be fairly straightforward. It typically only requires 15 - 30 minutes to complete. 					
				Got headphones? Ready to begin? Press play & let's go.					
ARCHETYPE_FOUNDATION	The Archetype			Let's talk about the set & setting for a positive experience with the highly psychoactive Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP.					
				"""Set"" refers to the mental state & personality structure you bring to the experience - thoughts, moods and/or expectations."					
				We have found that a relaxed, curious individual is more likely to have a pleasant experience with S:S&S EP.					
				"""Setting"" includes the comfort, security & warmth of the room or outdoor environment where the experience will occur."					
				"The second aspect of ""Setting"" is the cultural - prevailing notions of reality & normalcy. We will avoid this discussion for now."					
				S:S&S EP does not produce the transcendent experience, it is merely intended to free the nervous system of ordinary patterns.					
				"The expanded consciousness, the untapped & limitless potential of the mind, is what we at Superbrothers refer to as ""sworcery""."					
				The song of sworcery can be understood as a psionics technique & it allows you to perceive a reality within the one that you know.					
				To stop the song of sworcery at any time, simply tip tap upon the sworcery aura that surrounds The Scythian.					
				Once you have begun to sing a song of sworcery, ever-so-gently touch & swipe on the sworcery aura to look around.					
				To sing a song of sworcery at any time, touch & hold upon The Scythian for a moment or two & observe the gathering sworcery aura.					
				As you can see, The Megatome gathers & collects linguistic thought transmissions. Scroll down to see what I was thinking before.					
ARCHETYPE_MEGATOMETUTORIAL	The Scythian		adventureUI/megatomeItem	"""Very nicely done - you've learned the Song of Sworcery & now the unfathomable power of The Megatome is yours."""			47	012.jpg	31E2F
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	"""The Megatome intercepts linguistic thought-transmissions & it contains everything you'll need to complete your woeful errand."""					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	"I'm thinking about something right this moment... why not open The Megatome & look for me to find out what's on my mind?"					
				"""Look for a white triangle in the top-right... tap it & then equip The Megatome... then rotate to reveal what is hidden."""					
LOGFELLA_STORM	The Scythian			The woodsman known as Logfella had given up on his wood-chopping due to the sinister storm. #wetboots					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	Logfella reminded us of how the storm rolled in pretty much right after we had retrieved The Megatome from beneath Mingi Taw.					
				Was Logfella not-so-subtly suggesting that maybe we oughta try to do something to lift the storm? #yes #no #maybe					
GIRL_STORM	The Scythian			The dark haired girl known as Samae was feeling the woe. #woe					
			gourd/gourd	Ever since the storm began Samae had seen the sonorous spumes of sylvan sprites who slumbered in the woods nearby.					
			gourd/gourd	She wondered if maybe the three sylvan sprites could help lift the storm? #yes					
			gourd/gourd	She asked us to investigate the sonorous spume bubbling up out of the deepwater pond outside the hut.					
			gourd/gourd	Samae spoke of a sprite in a meadow nearby & yet another sprite in a nestbox that was home to three rain-soaked songbirds.					
			gourd/gourd	Samae told us to seek the sonorous spumes of these three sylvan sprites & send them skyward with the song of sworcery.					
ARCHETYPE_SWORCERY	The Archetype			"""It is time to learn the Song of Sworcery - a consciousness expansion technique that reveals a mystical musical dimension."""					
			gourd/gourd	"""Keep calm & follow my directions to summon the sylvan sprite that softly slumbers in the cool waters of the deepwater pond."""					
ARCHETYPE_TADPOLES	The Archetype			It was 100% obvious that the strangely-attired man expected us to do something or other but we had no idea what.					
			gourd/gourd	"""Do you see the sonorous spume in the deepwater pond? A sylvan sprite softly slumbers there & you must summon it."""					
			gourd/gourd	"""Sing a Song of Sworcery at any time by touching & holding on The Scythian to access a reality within the one you know."""					
			gourd/gourd	"""Guide the two tiny swimming things to where the sprite slumbers & then send the sprite skyward with three touches of sworcery."""			49	013.jpg	61D3A

			triangle/Triangle	As we stood beside the first stone structure we thought of The Gold Trigon & we felt our sword stir.

				We wondered what would happen if we struck the stone structure with our sword.

GRAVE_TRIGONGROVE	The Scythian			In The Trigon Grove beyond the cavernous cave in the meadow we spied a solitary grave & we got a little bit curious about it.					
GRAVE_TRIGONGROVEGHOST	The Scythian			In The Trigon Grove beyond the cavernous cave in the meadow we approached a solitary grave & were met by a glowing ghost dude.					
				The glowing ghost dude in The Trigon Grove totally freaked us out at first to be honest.			96	022.jpg	T2B2H
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	He recognized our Scythian garb & he saw that we carried The Megatome. He wondered if we understood the esoteric markings inside.					
				In a whisper he spoke the name of the deathless spectre we had awoken in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw: The Gogolithic Mass.			166	023.jpg	O2B39
				We knew the dreadful name from the old stories & we felt our blood run cold.					
				"""Up until now I had the feeling that The Gogolithic Mass saw you as a bit of a tourist."""					
			triangle/Triangle	"""Now that you've learned the Song of Sworcery & tamed The Gold Trigon you will find your every step is haunted."""					
				We couldn't tell if the glowing ghost dude was cheering us on or psyching us out or what.					
				We told the ghost dude of our intention to detonate The Megatome atop Mingi Taw & release The Gogolithic Mass from immortality.					
			Archetype/trifecta	We asked about The Trigon Trifecta & the locations of the remaining two Trigons but his response was irritatingly obtuse.					
				"""The remaining two Trigons exist only in the dreams of the mountain folk."""			43	024.jpg	82E45
				"""Locating the remaining two Trigons is not so much a question of where as it is when & how."""

GRAVE_LOGBRIDGEGHOST	The Scythian			We approached a collection of graves in a thicket to the side of the old road & we met a few ghosts who seemed friendly.			116	025.jpg	62B55

GRAVE_CHASM	The Scythian			We spied the solitary grave at the edge of The Perilous Precipice & we wondered what was up with that.					
GRAVE_CHASMGHOST	The Scythian			At The Perilous Precipice we approached the solitary grave of the cheating cheater & met an old glowing ghost dude.

				The old glowing ghost spoke of the Date/Time option & the moon-altering horrors that lurked within.					
				"""The thing is I've had a serious case of the heebie jeebies pretty much ever since I did that & actually I died of shame."""					
GRAVE_HOLLOW	The Scythian			Inside a titanic hollow tree we spied a solitary grave & we got a little bit curious about it.

LOGFELLA_LOSTKEY	The Scythian			The woeful woodsman known as Logfella was totally freaking out about something.					
			AdventureUI/keyItem	Apparently Logfella had lost the key to the locked door in the stone wall that blocked the old road to Mingi Taw.					
				We were like groan not another fetch quest amirite?					
				Logfella told us he had been sitting right there by the fire when he had fallen into a deep sleep.					
			AdventureUI/keyItem	Logfella said he thought he had lost his key in the twilight realm of dreams.					
				We had heard about the strange dreams of the dark-haired mountain folk of The Caucasus so this made perfect sense to us.					
				Logfella invited us to warm our boots by the fire & dream along with him.			63	029.jpg	U2C92
ARCHETYPE_LOSTKEYTHOUGHTS	The Archetype			We think of wakefulness & the mythopoetic psychocosmology of dreams as separate states, however they interoperate in curious ways.					
				The threshold of liminality is a space in-between wakefulness & dreams where directed thought is impossible.			56	030.jpg	13A0A
				Seek a warm hearth & allow sleep to come to discover the threshold of liminality.					
ARCHETYPE_LOSTKEYCLUE	The Archetype		AdventureUI/keyItem	How's about you go sit down beside the hearth in the hut & cross the liminal threshold to find Logfella's lost key?			55	031.jpg	23C1X
GIRL_LOSTKEYTHOUGHTS	Girl	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		Whoa, Logfella is freaking out about something... I wonder what's up? I'll just head outside & leave him be for a bit.					
				I've seen The Scythian sing a Song of Sworcery & send three sylvan sprites skyward - I wonder if they will help soothe the storm?					
LOGFELLA_MORELOSTKEYTHOUGHTS	Logfella			I sure hope the dream-walking Scythian can find my lost key... I lost it on the sandy shore of a placid lake.			62	032.jpg	U3A20
LOGFELLA_LOSTKEYTHOUGHTS	Logfella			Oh woe, I wish it wasn't raining outside... I wish my boots weren't so wet... I wish I could go back to my wood-chopping.					
				Oh nuts - where has my key gone!? I'm so upset & ashamed so now I'm totally freaking out!					
LOGFELLA_FOUNDKEY	The Scythian		AdventureUI/keyItem	The woodsman was super relieved that we had managed to retrieve his lost key from the twilight realm of dreams.					
				The woodsman known as Logfella wondered how we got so smart & he asked about our woeful errand.					
				We told the woodsman how we had come of age on the steppes alongside our fearless Scythian sisters & brothers.					
				We told Logfella why we wandered here in this mountain wilderness & how we were guided by the finger of an all-knowing God.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	We told Logfella about what we suspected the esoteric markings inside The Megatome might signify.					
			gourd/gourd	We had a hunch that we needed to summon a few more sylvan sprites to soothe the storm.			104	033.jpg	W3D3G
			triangle/Triangle	In a hushed whisper we spoke of our intention to locate & tame a manifestation of cosmic geometry known as The Gold Trigon.					
				It was 100% clear that the woodsman known as Logfella had stopped paying attention.					
			AdventureUI/keyItem	We figured we could just hang on to the key & go for a walk on the old road beyond the stone wall.					
LOGFELLA_FOUNDKEYWAKEUP	The Scythian		AdventureUI/keyItem	We asked the woodsman if it'd be ok for us to hang on to his key & he said that'd be totally cool.					
GIRL_FOUNDKEY	The Scythian			We met Samae standing rain-soaked on a sidepath.					
			gourd/gourd	She had heard the subtle sonorous spumes of the sylvan sprites from beyond the stone wall on the old road to Mingi Taw.					
			gourd/gourd	She spoke of towering tree trunks on either side of a mighty river.					
			gourd/gourd	She spoke of faint rainbows at the edge of The Perilous Precipice.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	...and then she grew fearful & told us to consult The Megatome if we became lost or confused.					
LOGFELLA_FOUNDKEYTHOUGHTS	Logfella			I'm totally cool with The Scythian hanging on to the key if it means she's going to soothe the storm.					
				I must've nodded off at some point during The Scythian's super epic story. I have a really low tolerance for lore.					
				I asked The Scythian point-blank about her woeful errand... she started talking about the steppes & the finger of God.					
GIRL_FOUNDKEYTHOUGHTS	Girl			One or two more sylvan sprites sent skyward will soothe the ceaseless storm... and then it will be a time of miracles! #miracles			129	034.jpg	33A44
GIRL_SUPERMOTHERTREE	Girl			In my dream-walking there is a thrilling stillness when the moon is brightest... and when the moon is darkest the woods are wild.					
				In the dream it's always the same places & spaces except for when it differs according to the moods of the moon.					
				Every night since the storm lifted I've had that same dream where I'm wandering in the woods in the hour before dawn.					
ARCHETYPE_TREEHINT	The Archetype			Remember that ingesting forest fungi may offer some oblique insight on cryptozoological phenomena & such.					
				Seek the sonorous spumes of the sylvan sprites & investigate their surroundings.					
				Once you have begun to sing a song of sworcery you can ever-so-gently touch & swipe on the sworcery aura to look around.					
ARCHETYPE_MUSHROOMHINT	The Archetype			It has even been asserted that divinatory mushrooms may have played a significant role in the development of the human psyche.					
				Archaelogical evidence indicates that the shamanic use of fungi for religious communion, divination and healing is quite ancient.					
				Physiologically you may notice feelings of well-being & heightened perceptions, a dissipation of stress & a loss of apetite.					
				Forest fungi may offer some oblique insight on the whereabouts of a sylvan sprite & their peculiar triggers.			60	035.jpg	53A5Y
ARCHETYPE_TRIGONGROVE	The Archetype			Can you feel it? Are you beginning to understand? Do the esoteric markings & shapes inside The Megatome hold new meaning?					
				This beam bridges the world of the living & the world of the dead, so you may find a ghost or two to talk to on your travels.					
				I've just been notified that you have activated the first skyward beam in the Trigon Grove.					
GIRL_CABINSHEEP	The Scythian			We asked Samae about the worthless sheep hanging out around the hut & she said they had taken fright a little while ago.					
			gourd/gourd	We told Samae we had sent five sylvan sprites skyward & she told us that perhaps a time of miracles was at hand.					
				We thought that maybe we oughta go investigate the meadow where the sheep used to be.					
LOGFELLA_CABINSHEEP	The Scythian			Logfella had the feeling that it was a time of miracles & he wondered if maybe something awesome was about to happen.			79	036.jpg	V3G62
GIRL_CABINSHEEPTHOUGHTS	Girl			What in the... the rain has stopped! Is the storm starting to lift? I sure hope so.					
				This whole storm thing has really been getting me down. It has been so gloomy.					
LOGFELLA_CABINSHEEPTHOUGHTS	Logfella			Hmm.... I'm getting a case of the heebie-jeebies... something's definitely happening... is the storm starting to lift?					
				Y'know whenever I feel like I need to gather my strength I just sit down beside this here hearth to warm my boots.					
DOGFELLA_CABINSHEEPTHOUGHTS	Dogfella			Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark. #stillbarking #miracles			84	037.jpg	V3C7I
ARCHETYPE_MEADOWHINT	The Archetype			Once the sun is in alignment you'll be granted the miraculous fold-in abilities of the great wizard Al Jaffee.					
				Are you feeling that peculiar vibe? It is a time of miracles! Sing a Song of Sworcery & look up to the looming angry birds.			76	038.jpg	A3G84
ARCHETYPE_MEADOWHINTTWO	The Archetype			Look to the heavens for some oblique insight into the workings of this miracle in the meadow & then behold The Gold Trigon.					
ARCHETYPE_SIDE_B	The Archetype	AdventureUI/tweetIconInfo		Hmm... interesting the way you handled that encounter with the bear-headed cannibal fellow.			120	039.jpg	O3G9D
				No no, it's fine, it's just interesting. I've never seen anyone do what you did. It's exceptional, but don't be alarmed.					
				Well, carry on. There's ever-so-much-more of the S:S&S EP experience for you to enjoy, particularly on Side B.					
ARCHETYPE_GOLDTRIGONHINTONE	The Archetype			To tame The Gold Trigon you must learn to survive the three movements of its bizarre song using a mixture of attack & defense.					
				It is absolutely essential that you touch & hold the shield button whenever you can in order to recover your lost strength.					
				So I see you've summoned & attempted to tame The Gold Trigon? I have a few things to tell you that I think you'll find useful.					
ARCHETYPE_GOLDTRIGONHINTTWO	The Archetype			Swing at the Trigon's psionic projectile attacks with your sword & wait for opportunities to dodge any incoming beam attacks.			83	040.jpg	34E01 
				The Gold Trigon's inscrutable & unguessable logic has claimed the souls of all who came before... they lacked tenacity & courage.					
ARCHETYPE_GOLDTRIGONHINTTHREE	The Archetype			The Gold Trigon must be tamed, there is no other option.					
				In the third pattern you must swing at the small triangle projectiles with your sword & evade incoming beam attacks. 					
				In the second pattern you must wait for an incoming beam attack & press the shield button to evade when the time is right.					
				In the first pattern you must swing your sword to return the ball of energy.					
ARCHETYPE_BRIGHTTRIGONHINTONE	The Archetype			You may have noticed The Bright Moon Trigon delivers death from above... so wait for the right time & tap your shield to evade.			144	041.jpg	84E11
ARCHETYPE_BRIGHTTRIGONHINTTWO	The Archetype			The Bright Moon Trigon's final patten will require you to swing your sword at projectiles & evade charged beam attacks.					
ARCHETYPE_DARKTRIGONHINTONE	The Archetype			You may have encountered The Dark Moon Trigon's loathsome rainbow attack - slice at that rainbow as hard & as fast as you can.					
ARCHETYPE_DARKTRIGONHINTTWO	The Archetype			The Dark Moon Trigon's final pattern involves sneakily subtle triangular projectiles - smash them & you'll survive.					
ARCHETYPE_MEGATOMEOUTRO	The Archetype	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook		So you've awoken the deathless spectre who slumbered in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw - yikes!					
				Consequently, a sinister thunderstorm looms & the lovely people who live in the stone hut are a little heartbroken.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	The upshot is that you got the burdensome book known as The Megatome - in our next session we'll discuss its strange purpose.					
				Our research shows that prolonged exposure to the mythopoetic psychocosmology of S:S&S EP can have adverse side effects.					
				So now that you've completed session I how's about we take a little break? I'll be right here when you're ready for session II.					
ARCHETYPE_GOLDMASTERINTRO	The Archetype	AdventureUI/tweetIconBabelBook							
				It's lovely to see you again. Are you ready to begin session II of S:S&S EP?					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	Ok, so where were we? Oh right, now I remember. You got a burdensome book known as The Megatome.					
				You woke the deathless spectre who still lurks in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw. What a creep, amirite?			204	042.jpg	24B2J
				It is a time of woe - a sinister thunderstorm has clouded the skies & the lovely people who live in the hut are miserable.					
				Silencing the storm will require some familiarity with psionics, cryptozoology & miracles...					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	1. A sworcerer's touch will unseal The Megatome, revealing the unspoken thoughts of living creatures & other esoteric material.					
			gourd/gourd	2. Strange sylvan sprites - swources of sworcery - slumber in ponds, woods & meadows. Seek their subtle sonorous spumes.					
			triangle/Triangle	3. A sworcerer who can locate, summon & tame the cosmic geometry of The Golden Trigon will possess the ability to work miracles.					
				Confused? Excellent. Keep calm & carry on.			210	043.jpg	A4C31
ARCHETYPE_GOLDMASTEROUTRO	The Archetype		triangle/Triangle	Bravo! You have located & subdued the cosmic geometry of The Golden Trigon.			86	044.jpg	24E4H
				Miraculously the sinister storm has lifted & glorious sunlight has returned to the realm so that's totally awesome.					
				These heroic deeds reflect well upon your perceptiveness, intuition & perseverance - you have done exceedingly well so far.					
				Note: Should you choose to continue the S:S&S EP experiment, those aforementioned qualities will be challenged & evaluated.					
				In any case, let's take another little break, shall we? As always, I'll be right here whenever you're ready to begin session III.					
ARCHETYPE_TRIFECTAINTRO	The Archetype								
				Let's begin session III. Note: This session typically requires a lunar month to complete.					
			triangle/Triangle	So you have tamed The Gold Trigon & the storm has miraculously lifted? Bravo on that.					
			adventureUI/megatomeItem	Consult The Megatome & study its workings should you become lost or confused.					
				A deathless spectre still lurks in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Consider the cosmic geometry of The Trigon Trifecta.					
			MoonCrescent/moonCrescent	Observe the moods of the moon.			118	045.jpg	Y4E5Q
				Our research has shown that those few who persist through the oblique lunacy that follows may become cosmic friends forever.					
				Be advised that henceforth we will be monitoring your inputs in relative silence.					
ARCHETYPE_TRIFECTAOUTRO	The Archetype		Archetype/trifecta	So you tamed the remaining two Trigons & re-assembled The Trigon Trifecta?			165	046.jpg	P4B6A
			Archetype/trifecta	You are special & that is exactly why I love you so much.					
				It was very brave & generous to offer to martyr The Scythian atop Mingi Taw.					
				Seriously we owe you one.					
				All that remains is for you to forcefully drag The Scythian's to the summit & witness the whirling infinite.					
				Take heart - the end is near!					
ARCHETYPE_GHOULINTRO	The Archetype								
				Well, here we are. This brief session will end the S:S&S EP treatment.					
				The Scythian's woeful errand is very nearly complete.					
				Sadly The Scythian's corporeal self & psyche have been significantly sapped by sworcery - she is at death's door.			162	047.jpg	J4F7B
			Archetype/trifecta	All that remains is to solve the secrets of The Trigon Grove & upload The Megatome to the whirling infinite atop Mingi Taw.					
				Press play if you're ready to bear witness to the awful torment of martyrdom.

GIRL_GHOULTHOUGHTS	Girl			Does The Scythian know that it's possible to stop The Gogolithic Mass by touching his skull with Sworcery? Probably not.					
				I sure hope The Scythian knows to touch & hold on the path ahead to move it move it extra fast, if she doesn't she'll be toast.					
				Where am I? What happened? The last thing I remember I was dream-walking in the woods when I saw an eerie pink light.					
LOGFELLA_GHOULTHOUGHTS	Logfella			The Scythian keeps talking about her woeful errand to open a gateway to the infinite on the summit of Mingi Taw.					
				Everything has been totally mental ever since The Scythian showed up so many moons ago.					
LOGFELLA_GHOUL	The Scythian			We groggily awoke from a super deep sleep to find ourselves near The Trigon Grove with the woodsman known as Logfella by our side.			88	054.jpg	J5D44
				Logfella spoke of how Samae had gone missing the night before.					
				The woodsman knew that our end was at hand & that we must return to Mingi Taw to finish our woeful errand.					
LOGFELLA_TRIGONGROVETIPS	The Scythian			The woodsman known as Logfella had never before seen The Trigon Grove before & he wondered what it was all about.					
LOGFELLA_TRIFECTATIPS	The Scythian			The woodsman known as Logfella was feeling some serious woe about the missing Samae.					
				We told Logfella that we knew where she might be & soon we would set things right. 					
				He looked at the nearby pedestal & he thanked us in advance for the whole martyrdom thing.

				Bark Sniff Bark. #mixingitup					
				Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark.					
GCLUE_UPSLOPEWOODSONE	Girl	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		Still there's something strange about how The Scythian behaved, almost as if she was being controlled by an unseen force.					
				I kind of wish I knew more about The Scythian's compelling & epic backstory because I bet it would make sense of everything.					
GCLUE_UPSLOPEWOODSTWO	Logfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		I sure hope The Scythian is on the case with the whole sylvan sprite thing.					
				The storm has really been getting me down, it makes me wish that videogames existed in... whenever this is supposed to be.

GCLUE_YELLOWCOLLECTED	Girl	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		This whole storm thing has really been getting me down. It has been sooo gloomy.					
				The rain has started to ease & the sky seems to be brightening... is it a time of miracles? I sure hope so. I love miracles.					
				Whoa... what? The sheep in the meadow have taken fright... I wonder what's happening over there? Could it be... The Gold Trigon?

				Sometimes when things are too dark for me to see I'll eat a little something and see what isn't even there.					
				Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark.					
GCLUE_SECRET2_STONESHELTER	Logfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		I've got this song in my head... a happy & sad little song that fills me with a weirdly beautiful dread.

GCLUE_LAKESHOREBUNNYSTRAIGHTAWAY	Dogfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		There are also unknown nouns although these are easily learned.

				Bark Bark Bark. 					
GCLUE_LAKESHORELAKE	Logfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		My logs have many secrets... secrets about sylvan sprites & impossible islands. Unfortunately I don't speak log-language.					
				In my experience there are times when owls are not what they seem & at other times they're just plain old owls.			126	064.jpg	86A47
GCLUE_PINKCOLLECTED	The Archetype	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		Perhaps you have already heard about an impossible island under a looming Bright Moon, maybe you read about it on the internet?			134	065.jpg	H6A5I
				We've been quietly monitoring your actions & we'd like to point out that the longer the hesitation, the smaller the celebration.					
				So it seems you've made a significant amount of progress in your effort to locate & tame The Bright Moon Trigon, very nicely done.					
GCLUE_MOUNTAINSIDE	Girl	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		Are the sylvan sprites children of the Earth or are they lonely visitors from the whirling infinite?					
				If I'm being honest the sylvan sprites totally freak me out. I mean... what are they? Where are they from?					
GCLUE_SECRET1_FOOTOFMOUNTAIN	Dogfella	AdventureUI/tweetIconGourd		When the sprites have been sent skyward & the time of miracles is upon you you must seek the titanic tree.

JIM_HINT1_OFF	The Scythian			In a secluded grove we met a mysterious musical fellow hanging out beside a crackling fire.					
JIM_PINKDAWN	The Scythian			In a secluded grove we met a mysterious fellow hanging out beside a crackling fire. #jimguthrie					
JIM_BRIGHTMOON	The Scythian			While the bright moon looms we met a mysterious musical fellow beside a crackling fire who introduced himself as Jim Guthrie.			128	070.jpg	07G00
JIM_POSTSWORCERY	The Scythian			The mysterious musical fellow known as Jim Guthrie had witnessed our sworcery & he seemed cool with it.					
JIM_POSTGOURD	The Scythian			The mysterious musical fellow known as Jim Guthrie said he was ready to play a little song if we wanted to give it a listen.					
				Jim invited us to take a seat by the fire.					
JIM_POSTSONG	The Scythian			Jim Guthrie had taught us that there was no denying the evil thoughts & no denying the dragon's bite.					
			Archetype/trifecta	He told us about rock show he was scheduled to play on the other side of the lake in a fortnight hence.					
JIM_LOGFELLATHOUGHTS	Logfella			The song sounds so familiar... where have I heard it before? #1000songs					
				I've suddenly got this awesomely weird little tune in my head. #andwegotolder					
LOGFELLA_JIMTHOUGHTS	Logfella			I've had this little song in my head for ages... just a few little notes that loop over and over. I wonder what that's about?					
ARCHETYPE_OTHERSIDEOFLAKE	The Archetype			Safely re-crossing the threshold of liminality is a simple matter - seek the familiar places & the warmth of the hearth.					
				Should you manage to stabilize your lucidity you will be able to co-create with it... instead of fighting, resisting & cursing it.					
				When you're lucid in a dream you'll realize who you've imagined you are... but to identify with the dream is to become bewitched.					
				Even in a well-worn dream space there are new places to explore & new connections to consider... if you continue to believe.					
GIRL_MOONGROTTOCOMMENT	Girl			I'm kinda feeling like maybe the cosmos just skipped a beat & now everything is just a little bit... off.					
LOGFELLA_MOONGROTTOCOMMENT	Logfella			It's a long way from 0 to 1 & if an alien said hello it'd be in cryptic code on the stereo. Wait... what?					
GIRL_HUGETREETHOUGHTS	Girl			Of course I never tell people about these goddess/tree dreams because they'll probably just call me a hippie or something.					
				In my special place I visit with a titanic hollow tree... she is a goddess long-since dead who predates mankind by untold eons.					
				In my dream-walking there is a special place I will always go, a parliament of trees at the heart of the world.					
LOGFELLA_HUGETREETHOUGHTS	Logfella			I love seeing the same woods in different weather & I love to just stop and listen... to think or to not think as the case may be.					
				I don't spend too much time dream-walking but when I do I tend to just re-visit my favorite places to see what has changed.					
MIRACLE1_MOUNTAINMEADOW	The Scythian			We have enacted a storm-lifting miracle in a sunlit meadow in the fold-in fashion of the mad wizard Al Jaffee.					
MIRACLE1_YELLOWTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			We are left confused & bewildered in a sun-dappled meadow with one of those really brutal headaches.					
LOGFELLA_YELLOWTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			We groggily awoke from a super deep sleep with no firm recollection of what had happened.					
			triangle/Triangle	We were reminded of the miracle in the meadow & our encounter with The Gold Trigon... 					
			triangle/Triangle	... what new powers had we been granted?					
			triangle/Triangle	Logfella was totally floored at how awesome & crazy the fight with The Gold Trigon sounded from the description we gave him.			81	071.jpg	R7C14
			triangle/Triangle	Logfella wondered about how maybe The Gold Trigon might be connected to the grim mysteries beyond the iron gate in the meadow.					
				Logfella didn't dig grim mysteries so he chose to go home & chop wood. #woodchopping					
LOGFELLA_BEFOREYELLOWBEAM	The Scythian			The woodsman known as Logfella was super pleased that the storm had lifted & he was super keen to be wood-chopping again.					
				He asked us if we knew anything about the iron gate blocking the cavernous cave in meadow... what was that about?					
LOGFELLA_YELLOWTRIGONTHOUGHTS	Logfella			Strange... I see a golden skyward beam in the woods behind the meadow... has someone learned the secrets of The Trigon Grove?			89	072.jpg	67F24
LOGFELLA_URSULAMEADOW	Logfella			I'm really worried about The Scythian, she seems so messed up.					
SCYTHIAN_YELLOWTRIGONCOLLECTED_OFF	The Scythian			The woodsman & his daughter looked over us as we came to our senses.					
				We noticed the meadow was unchanged, that all evidence of our mystical encounter was gone.					
GIRL_YELLOWTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			Samae listened quietly to our strange story about our encounter with The Gold Trigon.					
			triangle/Triangle	She wondered about the secrets of The Trigon Grove beyond the cavernous cave in the meadow... was there a connection?					
GIRL_YELLOWTRIGONTHOUGHTS	Girl			Hmm... I'm getting really worried about The Scythian... she disappeared for days after the storm lifted. I sure hope she's ok.					
GIRL_URSULAMEADOW_OFF	Girl			Whoa, so The Scythian was just passed out in the meadow? Crazy.					
DOGFELLA_GETDARKTRIGON	The Scythian			After activating another skyward beam in The Trigon Grove we noticed something peculiar about the dog known as Dogfella.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Suddenly it seemed we understood Dogfella - he urged us to seek The Dark Moon Trigon & complete The Trigon Trifecta.					
DOGFELLA_GETBRIGHTTRIGON	The Scythian			After activating another skyward beam in The Trigon Grove we noticed something peculiar about the dog known as Dogfella.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Suddenly it seemed we understood Dogfella - he urged us to seek The Bright Moon Trigon & complete The Trigon Trifecta.					
DOGFELLA_THREETRIGONS	The Scythian			After activating another skyward beam in The Trigon Grove we noticed something peculiar about the dog known as Dogfella.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Suddenly it seemed we understood Dogfella - he urged us to activate the third skyward beam & open a gateway to the infinite.					
DOGFELLA_TRUTHBOMB	Dogfella			Bark Bark Bark.					
				Bark Bark Sniff Bark.					
				The whirling infinite cosmos at the summit of Mingi Taw awaits the one who carries The Megatome.					
				Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark.					
				Bark Bark Bark.					
GIRL_AFTERYELLOWBEAM	The Scythian			Samae sat on a stone beside where the woodsman chopped wood.					
			Archetype/trifecta	We asked her about the secrets of The Trigon Grove & the peculiar dreams of the mountain folk of the Caucasus.					
				She told us about how the dreams of her people held many mysteries & how they reflected the moods of the moon in strange ways.					
				Samae told us to sit by the hearth in the stone hut at any time either to go dream-walking or to gather our strength.					
			Archetype/trifecta	We kinda got the feeling that the remaining two Trigons might be lost in dreams or something like that.					
LOGFELLA_AFTERYELLOWBEAM	The Scythian			The woodsman known as Logfella had returned to his wood-chopping & he seemed to really be digging it.					
			triangle/Triangle	Logfella had seen the skyward beam in the sky behind the meadow & so we asked him about the secrets of The Trigon Grove.					
				He spoke of an old story that his people typically told their children to freak them out.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Logfella spoke of a posse from Scythia who had come seeking The Trigon Trifecta in these forgotten mountains many moons ago.					
			gourd/gourd	The posse had learned to seek sylvan sprites & send them all skyward... and then they had sought a location to enact a miracle.					
			Archetype/trifecta	The posse had hoped to activate the three skyward beams in The Trigon Grove but they had no idea where or when the Trigons were.					
				The posse wandered aimlessly for a long time on the old road to Mingi Taw... eventually they grew weary & so they stopped.					
				Then the posse was suddenly killed by a deathless spectre by the side of the old road where a handful of graves remain to this day.					
				We told Logfella that it was a nice story but actually it didn't freak us out all that much.

ARCHETYPE_MOONGROTTO	The Archetype			So I see you've managed to alter the mood of the moon in The Moon Grotto - I wonder how long this Time Paradox will last?					
MIRACLE2_ISLAND	The Scythian			While the Bright Moon looms we have enacted a super weird moon-miracle on an impossible island in the midst of a placid lake.			136	073.jpg	W7A3K
MIRACLE2_PINKTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			We got The Bright Moon Trigon for glory & for spite. #trigontamed			155	068.jpg	56F8U
MIRACLE2_BRIGHTMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			We were tempted to maybe just stop with the whole woeful errand thing but there was just something so attractive about martyrdom.					
				Oh well, it probably won't matter too much in the end. It's not like entry into The Whirling Infinite involves a physical exam.					
				We had the distinct feeling that all this dream-walking & Trigon taming was starting to take its toll.					
				When the light & the sound subsided we found ourselves on the shores of a lake with a brutal headache & a bloody nose.					
GIRL_BRIGHTMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian		Archetype/trifecta	We spoke to Samae about our dream-encounter with The Bright Moon Trigon & our intention to re-assemble The Trigon Trifecta.					
				She said our dream-encounter sounded really cool & she wished she could've been there. #lies					
				She asked us if we had stopped by The Trigon Grove... perhaps we could activate another skyward beam?					
LOGFELLA_BRIGHTMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			The woodsman could see that our dream-walking & miracle-working had taken a heavy toll on our physical health.					
				Logfella seemed to suspect that this woeful errand of ours probably didn't have a happy ending.					
				Logfella reminded us to sit down by the hearth in the hut & take a break every now and again to gather our strength.					
ARCHETYPE_BRIGHTMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Archetype			Our research data shows a high correlation between a participant's progress in S:S&S EP & their aptitude for being awesome.			45	074.jpg	87A43
				I see you have managed to locate & retrieve The Bright Moon Trigon - this is remarkable news indeed.					
MIRACLE3_HUGETREE	The Scythian			While the Dark Moon reigns we have enacted a splintering thunderbolt miracle amidst a parliament of trees.					
MIRACLE3_DARKMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			Also... carrying around The Megatome all over the place is kind of a pain, it really is a burdensome book in more ways than one.					
				We were feeling a little worse for wear... it was probably something to do with all those cosmic laser bolts.					
				When the light & the sound subsided we found ourselves rain-soaked & cold amid a parliament of trees.					
GIRL_DARKMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian		Archetype/trifecta	We spoke to Samae about our dream-encounter with The Dark Moon Trigon & our intention to re-assemble The Trigon Trifecta.					
				We told her about how we had smashed The Dark Moon Trigon's loathsome rainbow attack & she was all like 'cool'.					
				She didn't seem to mind listening to our crazy stories.					
LOGFELLA_DARKMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Scythian			The woodsman could see that our dream-walking & miracle-working had taken a heavy toll on our physical health.					
			Archetype/trifecta	Logfella asked us if we had visited with Dogfella in The Trigon Grove... perhaps we could activate another skyward beam?					
ARCHETYPE_DARKMOONTRIGONCOLLECTED	The Archetype			So now the question is... what's next?					
				Despite the scarcity of useful information we have provided you have managed to master the Dark Moon Trigon.					
				I've just been informed that you have retrieved The Dark Moon Trigon - this is remarkable news indeed.					
LOGFELLA_FOUNDBOORKEY	The Scythian		AdventureUI/keyItem	The woodsman didn't recognize the key that we had found & he had zero idea what it was for.					
			AdventureUI/keyItem	...?					
GIRL_FOUNDBOORKEY	The Scythian		AdventureUI/keyItem	Samae saw the key that we had found & she encouraged us to keep our eyes open for a locked door.					
				She didn't have any other ideas but we were reminded of something we had seen on the old road to Mingi Taw.					
ARCHETYPE_GROTTOPARADOX	The Archetype								
				Once the moods of the moon have been altered in The Moon Grotto the 					
ARCHETYPE_KILLBOOR	The Archetype			Now I imagine you might be wondering what that key is for? To be honest, I have no idea.			119	075.jpg	87C5S
				Not that I'm suggesting that you are in fact a violent sociopath... haha... I'm sure you had your reasons, right? #thegrizzledboor					
				I should mention that The Grizzled Boor was included in S:S&S EP to tempt participants into identifying as violent sociopaths.					
				I've just been informed that The Grizzled Boor has been slain... do you know anything about this? #slaughter					
ARCHETYPE_SPAREBOOR	The Archetype			Now I imagine you might be wondering what that key is for? To be honest, I have no idea.			119	075.jpg	87C5S
				So yeah, that's awesome & we love love you for it.					
				The Grizzled Boor was included in S:S&S EP to allow participants to self-identify as compassionate, reasonable people.					
				I've just been informed that The Grizzled Boor has been allowed to escape unharmed. This is heartening news.					
LOGFELLA_FOUNDATION	Logfella			...					
				...					
				...					
SCYTHIAN_FOUNDATION	The Scythian			We just woke a sylvan sprite from a deepwater pond fringed with lilies beside a stone hut. We are not sure what that means.					
				With a ceaseless storm overhead we have learned to sing a Song of Sworcery & summon a slumbering sylvan sprite.					
				Wait... why am I referring to myself in first person? I thought our story was told in second person? #editingoversight					
				Are my thoughts arranged chronologically, in the order I thought them? So this must be what I was thinking a few seconds ago?					
				So this is The Megatome? Is it absorbing 'linguistic thought transmissions'? Am I reading my thoughts as I'm thinking them? Hmm...					
GIRL_FOUNDATION	Girl			...					
				...					
				...					
DOGFELLA_FOUNDATION	Dogfella			...					
				...					
				...					
LOGFELLA_DARKMOON	The Scythian			The woodsman spoke of his dream-walking in the woods in the hour before dawn under a dark & storm-filled sky.					
				He spoke of a throbbing pink light & an eerie song full of dread emanating from the nameless woods behind the meadow.					
				We figured Logfella was probably talking about The Dark Moon Rock Show.					
GIRL_DARKMOON	The Scythian			Samae spoke of her dream-walking in the woods in the hour before dawn under a dark & storm-filled sky.					
				She spoke of how she had taken shelter from the thunder storm in the hollowed-out trunk of a titanic tree.					
				We totally knew which titanic hollow tree she was talking about.					
ARCHETYPE_DARKMOON	The Archetype			Take heed: The Dark Moon reigns.			94	076.jpg	I7F69
LOGFELLA_CRESCENTWAX	The Scythian			The woodsman spoke of his dream-walking in the woods in the hour before dawn, under a crescent moon.					
				He spoke of a creature he had met, someone or something both strange & nude. Was it a bear? A man? Or... The Grizzled Boor?			57	077.jpg	I7G7U
GIRL_CRESCENTWAX	The Scythian			Samae was excited - today was the start of a whole new lunar month! She looked forward to long days sitting on rocks.					
ARCHETYPE_CRESCENTWAX	The Archetype			The sliver of a crescent moon has appeared, marking the start of a new twenty-eight day lunar cycle.			118	045.jpg	Y4E5Q
LOGFELLA_HALFWAX	The Scythian			The woodsman admitted that yes, indeed, he had chopped a decent amount of firewood in his time.					
				He spoke of the frigid winters & deep snows here amongst the mighty Caucasus mountains that rise above the steppes of Scythia.					
				The woodsman aspired to have enough food & firewood to survive the long cold months to come.					
GIRL_HALFWAX	The Scythian			In my dream last night I was walking in the woods & I was totally craving a muffin, but there were zero muffins.			108	078.jpg	07D87
ARCHETYPE_HALFWAX	The Archetype			Lunatic folklorists have asserted that there is no causal link between madness & the moods of the moon.					
LOGFELLA_ALMOSTWAX	The Scythian			The woodsman said that he never used to think all that much about The Gogolithic Mass & the mountain wilderness of Mingi Taw.					
				However, in the last little while, he said that the spectral presence of The Gogolithic Mass had started to haunt him.					
				The woodsman said he gets the heebie-jeebies when The Bright Moon looms in the sky above & when The Dark Moon reigns.					
GIRL_ALMOSTWAX	The Scythian			Samae remarked upon the growing moon... she wondered how long it would be until The Bright Moon loomed in the sky above.					
ARCHETYPE_ALMOSTWAX	The Archetype			The moon grows slightly with each passing day... in a few days it will be The Bright Moon... so what?			165	046.jpg	P4B6A
LOGFELLA_BRIGHTMOON	The Scythian			The woodsman admitted that his dog seemed to go a bit mental whenever The Bright Moon loomed in the sky above.			135	061.jpg	M6F1I
GIRL_BRIGHTMOON	The Scythian			Samae spoke of her dream-walking in the woods in the hour before dawn, with The Bright Moon looming in the sky above.					
				She spoke of the crisp morning air & an impossible island in the midst of a placid lake.					
ARCHETYPE_BRIGHTMOON	The Archetype			Go outside & look up - marvel at The Bright Moon looming in the sky above!			95	079.jpg	07D95
LOGFELLA_ALMOSTWANE	The Scythian			The woodsman had a low tolerance for lore & he admitted it usually put him to sleep. Nevertheless, he was quite knowledgeable.					
				The woodsman knew all about Mingi Taw & why it was known as The Kingdom of The Cloud.					
				He knew that Mingi Taw was the tallest mountain in the known world, taller even than Mt. Olympus where the Akhean gods dwelt.					
				He also knew that the summit of Mingi Taw, always shrouded by cloud, was thought to be the gateway to the whirling infinite.					
				The woodsman had never dared tread upon the horror-haunted slopes of Mingi Taw & he never would.					
GIRL_ALMOSTWANE	The Scythian			Samae wondered why so many mushrooms grew immediately before & after The Bright Moon... what was the cause?					
ARCHETYPE_ALMOSTWANE	The Archetype			The moon is slightly less bright than it was yesterday & the lunar cycle is beginning to wind down.					
LOGFELLA_HALFWANE	The Scythian			The woodsman had a low tolerance for lore & he admitted it usually put him to sleep. Nevertheless, he was quite knowledgeable.					
				The woodsman explained that in Scythia & in Persia, Mingi Taw is known as The Eternal Mountain.					
				The woodsman spoke of how, ages ago, a long forgotten race had carved a temple into the living rock beneath Mingi Taw.					
				The woodsman spoke of the subterranean corridors & cavernous spaces carved into the living rock beneath Mingi Taw.					
				According to the woodsman, those cavernous spaces were carved ages ago for the safe-keeping of The Megatome.					
GIRL_HALFWANE	The Scythian			Samae said she had gone walking beyond the stone wall & she had felt the dreadful presence of The Gogolithic Mass.			30	080.jpg	V8B04
ARCHETYPE_HALFWANE	The Archetype			The lunar cycle is winding down & The Dark Moon is less than a week away.					
LOGFELLA_CRESCENTWANE	The Scythian			The woodsman had a low tolerance for lore & he admitted it usually put him to sleep. Nevertheless, he was quite knowledgeable.					
				The woodsman knew about The Gogolithic Mass, the deathless spectre who lurked in the darkness beneath Mingi Taw.					
				Logfella spoke of the whirling infinite beyond our comprehension whence came The Megatome in the dimly-remembered age of stone.					
				He spoke of a race of immortal space-beings who sparked in mankind a rudimentary form of linguistic thought-transmission.					
				These immortals blessed mankind with the capacity for civilization & thus doomed them to an eventual, inevitable, extinction.					
				The Scythians sought to suppress the insidious creep of civilization & so they isolated The Megatome with its immortal protector.					
				The immortal has lingered in the darkness ever since, deteriorating to become a deathless spectre known as The Gogolithic Mass.					
				The woodsman probably would've kept going & going with this nonsense if we hadn't respectfully stopped him.					
GIRL_CRESCENTWANE	The Scythian			Samae remarked upon the shrinking moon. She said soon it would be gone & The Dark Moon would reign.					
ARCHETYPE_CRESCENTWANE	The Archetype			The lunar cycle is almost complete, The Dark Moon is near at-hand.					
DARKMOONLOOMS_ARCHETYPE	The Archetype			The dark moon looms, the end of the lunar cycle is near at-hand.					
DARKMOONBEGINS_ARCHETYPE	The Archetype			Behold: it is the dark moon!			94	076.jpg	I7F69
DARKMOON_GIRLTHOUGHTS	Girl			In my dream-walking I came upon a parliament of trees wracked by lightning & I felt the presence of something deeply sacred.					
DARKMOON_LOGFELLATHOUGHTS	Logfella			Last night I heard the sound of throbbing music filtered through the woods behind my stone hut. What's up with that?					
DARKMOON_DOGFELLATHOUGHTS	Dogfella			Bark bark bark - in my sleeping state I saw only the subtle sonorous spumes of sylvan sprites.					
AMPHITHEATRE_OUTRO	The Scythian			We have re-assembled The Trigon Trifecta & we are heroes.			164	081.jpg	48G1Q
RABBITS_3MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 3 defenseless rabbits.					
RABBITS_7MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 7 defenseless rabbits - is this evidence of a deranged mind?					
RABBITS_13MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 13 defenseless rabbits.					
RABBITS_17MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 17defenseless rabbits. We are unstoppable.					
RABBITS_23MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 23 defenseless rabbits.					
RABBITS_37MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 37 defenseless rabbits. We are curious what will happen if we continue this murder spree.					
RABBITS_53MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 53 defenseless rabbits. Clearly we are suffering from an obsessive compulsive disorder.					
RABBITS_91MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 91 defenseless rabbits.					
RABBITS_107MURDERS	The Scythian			We have inexplicably murdered 107 defenseless rabbits. Perhaps our murderous compulsion will decrease if we stopped counting?

				In early 2010 it was announced that the project had won the IGF Mobile 'Achievement in Art' award, which was super rad.					
				The first live public demonstration of S:S&S EP occurred at a Hand Eye Society social event in Toronto on February 14th 2010 .					
				The first playable S:S&S EP build was presented to attendees & friends at GDC 2010 in San Francisco from March 9th -13th 2010.

				* * * WHAT IS S:S&S EP? * * *					
				S:S&S EP is intended as a brave experiment in Input Output Cinema, whatever that is supposed to be.					
				S:S&S EP is a fresh approach to the old school adventure videogame with an emphasis on audiovisual style.					
				S:S&S EP is inspired by the work of pioneering videogame creators Shigeru Miyamoto, Jordan Mechner, Eric Chahi & Fumito Ueda.					
				S:S&S EP is a fevered famicom dream.			38	082.jpg	28B24
				S:S&S EP has been built with the mythopoetic psychocosmology of Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery stories in mind.					
				S:S&S EP is a link to the past.			167	083.jpg	18E3V
				S:S&S EP is a first effort & so yes it's a bit experimental.					
				S:S&S EP's aesthetic concept is 'the archetypical videogame adventure'.					
				"S:S&S EP obliquely references Carl G. Jung & his fascinating ""Red Book"" all over the damn place."					
				S:S&S EP is a nifty little thing that I don't really understand that I think everyone should play on their touchtronic machinery.					
				S:S&S EP is a crude videogame haiku about life, love & death.					
				S:S&S EP is a choice cut of myth & dreams.					
				S:S&S EP has been created with a broad, literate audience in mind.					
				S:S&S EP was originally going to be called 'Poopsock'. This is actually true.					
				* * * IT'S OVER * * *					
				So what happens next with all of this? And what's that crazy transmission all about? What does the future hold?					
				If you'd like to order prints, apparel, records & videogames or whatever then look us up on the internet!					
				If you're enjoying the style of audiovisual entertainment offered by S:S&S EP then please spread the word!					
				Now we are cosmic friends forever, ok?
